## Why...

* I don't trust any readily available packaged solution, as it requires permission to read the website you're reading. I prefer to use from source code directly for security reason.
* Equal Knowledge Opportunities. I believe that everyone should have equal oportunities in knowing public information or knowledge. Those struggling to pay simply because of low or no income, they should not be excluded from the oportunities to learn. Education should be free for everyone regardless of their ability to pay.
